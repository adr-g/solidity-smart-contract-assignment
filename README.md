# SavingsVault

This project consists of a very simple smart contract called SavingsVault.

The goal of this project is not to build a complex application, but to demonstrate the basic use of Solidity and how to deploy and interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Functions

- `deposit()`  
  Allows ETH to be sent to the contract.

- `withdrawAll()`

- `getVaultBalance()`  
  Returns the current balance of the contract.

---

## Events

- `FundsDeposited`  
  Emitted when ETH is deposited into the contract.

- `FundsWithdrawn`  
  Emitted when ETH is withdrawn by the owner.
